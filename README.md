## Developers Notes

### Intro
This template have all things what a normal user needs.

All you may do is just to suggest new features, or modify for a new layout by forking this project and creating a new branch.

### Translate
Translations are keeped in folder `translations/`.

Feel free to translate this template to your language!

### Compile
This template is parted into several files, inside the "parts" folder.

This is for ease of management. Also, for the use of TypeScript, and its transpile-for-compatibility.

Build basic version of this template with [Super-Tpl](https://github.com/NaitLee/Super-Tpl) toolchain.

### Quick release
There's a python3 file `release.py` for quick release to a zip.

This will make as well as add translations to `generator-template.html`, thus it's ready for production use.

----

My principle is, a template should be learnt by others, just like other open-source projects.

This way, everything can keep alive.
